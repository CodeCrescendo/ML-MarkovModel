Hidden Markov Model

Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) extend Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), 
sharing temporal modeling principles. Both model sequential data with hidden states evolving over time.
However, DBNs offer more flexibility by accommodating multiple observed variables at each time 
step and modeling complex dependencies between them. While HMMs assume a simple Markov process
for state transitions, DBNs incorporate Bayesian networks' graphical structure, allowing richer
representations of dependencies and more sophisticated inference. DBNs excel in tasks where 
multiple interacting variables influence outcomes over time,
making them powerful tools for dynamic systems modeling and prediction in various 
fields like finance, healthcare, and speech recognition.
